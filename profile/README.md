# ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hi there

Welcome to the world of Angarium. We are a small UK-based tech company. Our name is inspired by the swift and reliable couriers of ancient Persia.

Our journey started with maintaining the Session Border Controller (SBC) cluster we built for a large contact centre by blending the magic of open-source gems like Kamailio, RTPEngine, and FreeSWITCH.
We needed to be able to monitor our cluster. We expanded on this idea and started developing a cloud-native monitoring and testing platform for contact centres.

What drives us is simple. We're all about being there for our customers, diving deep into tech problems (and loving every bit of it), pitching in for the greater good by maintaining and contributing to open-source projects, and leading the way without letting our egos get in the mix.

We're all about community feedback. So, if you use one of our projects, we would love to hear from you.

If you need help with your contact centre call and voice quality issues and need solutions to resolve them quickly, contact us ðŸ‘‡.
